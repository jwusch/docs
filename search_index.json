Building M2 has always been a goal of ours. The crowdfunding campaign was the catalyst that transformed us from friends and an idea to a company and a product. We are very thankful to everyone who enabled this transformation. We will repay you through our hard work and dedication to this project.\nWe would also like to thank the organizations that have helped build the communities that M2 relies on: Arduino, DIGI International, Digi-Key, the EFF, Hackaday, and Open Garages. Finally, to the developers who spend their own time building essential tools, answering questions on the forum, and testing, thank you.\n\nM2 Summary\nM2 Goals\nSpecification\nOutline of sections\nSafety\n\nM2 Summary\n\nM2 by Macchina is an open and versatile automotive interface that can take your car to the next level. Use it to customize your ride or as a development platform for your next product. M2 works with almost any vehicle and features an Arduino Due processor at its core. An XBee form factor socket allows for many wireless capabilities.\nRead more about M2 general features here.\nTo skip to the quick start guide click here.\nGoals\nAs we developed M2, we here at Macchina set out with the following goals in mind:\n\nHelp foster a new generation of car nerds\nDevelop an innovative product for a wide range of automotive functions\nSupport the DIY and Open Source ecosystem\nProvide companies with a great tool for fast prototyping\nDisplay our ability to develop and mass produce quality hardware\n\nSpecification\nM2 is an open source automotive interface that takes the form of a OBD2 \"Under-the-Dash\" dongle or hard-wired \"Under-the-hood\" device. M2 has all of the interface circuitry to connect to the 5+ standard OBD2 protocols and other interfaces (a second CAN bus, LIN bus, single wire CAN, etc). M2 has several options for connections to the outside world including: SD card, USB Device and Host, 20-pin (sort of standard) XBEE socket, and a general purpose connector.\nThe XBEE socket can accept several modules, including BTLE, WIFI, and CELLULAR and others.\n\nWe designed M2 to be modular.\nWireless Socket: M2 accommodates a wide variety of wireless options using the popular DIGI XBee form factor socket. Many inexpensive, plug-and-play boards already exist including BLE, WIFI, GSM, 3G, LTE, GPS and others. You can even reprogram M2 wirelessly.\nProcessor PCB: We chose the Arduino Due as the basis of M2's processor board. Shrinking the Due by well over 50% was no small task! We decided to make further improvements by using the High Speed SD card interface and writing the appropriate firmware libraries to allow for faster data logging. We also added several LED options and a couple switches for a more pleasant development experience. Lastly, we tacked on a EEPROM to store variables after power is cut to M2.\nInterface PCB: The goal is for M2 to be able to interface and communicate with as many cars as possible. We crammed 2 channels of CAN, 2 channels of LIN/K-LINE, a J1850 VPW/PWM and even a single-wire CAN (GMLAN) interface onto the board. Automotive environments require M2 to be seriously strong, so we built in plenty of protection circuitry. Lastly, we have 6 general purpose driver circuits, which can source and sink up to 1 amp of current at 12 volts!\nSections\n\nGetting started - Learn the basics of working with M2. From programming it to communicating with additional hardware.\nBuild Something - Get your project off to a good start.

This will verify both your Arduino IDE setup and your M2 device.\nThe following steps are needed to get started programming on the Macchina M2 with the Arduino IDE:\n\nInstall the Arduino Desktop IDE\nInstall the Macchina M2 Board Configuration\nInstall drivers\nBuild and upload a sketch\n\nArduino Desktop IDE\nFollow the official installation instructions for your operating system then return here to continue with Macchina M2 specific setup.\n\nWindows\nmacOS\nLinux\n\nMacchina M2 Board Configuration\nNow that you have the Arduino IDE Installed, you will add support for the for Macchina M2.\nFirst, you will tell the IDE where to find the Macchina board configuration files.  Go to File > Preferences.  Paste\nhttps://macchina.cc/package_macchina_index.json \ninto the Additional Board Manager URLs: box and press OK.  This tells the Arduino IDE where to look to find the board configuration files for Macchina boards.\nNext, you will open the Boards Manager to download the needed board configurations.  Find the board manager under Tools > Board: \"[...]\" > Boards Manager...\nIn the board manager, install Arduino SAM Boards (32-bit ARM Cortex-M3) by Arduino.  Then install Macchina SAM Boards (Install Arduino SAM Boards first) by Macchina.\nDrivers\nYou may need to install a driver to enable your computer to communicate with the Macchina M2 before you can send sketches to it.  The Macchina M2 is based on the Arduino Due and uses the same driver.  Please visit the official Arduino Due documentation for instructions on installing drivers.\nBe careful when plugging the micro-USB cable into your M2.  The M2's design allows you to put it in a case or enclosure.  The connector cable may stick out farther than you expect, because there needs to be clearance space for a case.\nWhen you have finished installing drivers, leave your Macchina M2 plugged into the computer.\nRunning your first sketch\nNow that you have the Arduino IDE setup and your M2 connected, you can run your first sketch on the M2 by performing the followings steps in the Arduino IDE.\nFirst, you will make Macchina M2 the active board.  Tools > Board: \"[...]\" > Macchina M2.\nNext, open the Blink sketch. File > Examples > 01. Basics > Blink.\nFinally, in the opened window, upload the sketch to your M2 board.  Sketch > Upload.\nIt will take a few moments for the sketch to be written as firmware to your Macchina M2.  You can watch the progress at the bottom of the IDE window.  When the upload has completed, you should see a flashing LED on your Macchina M2.\nCongratulations!  You have now configured your computer for development on the M2 and run your first program.  As a next step, you may choose to learn the names of the other LEDs on the Macchina M2 using the pin mapping.  Then you can practice modifying the sketch to make other LEDs blink.\n"},"m2/build-something/":{"url":"m2/build-something/","title":"Build Something","keywords":"","body":"Build Something\n\nSection Outline\nGoals\nIs M2 Limited to use in Cars?\nSafety Warning\nLink User Agreement\n\n"},"m2/build-something/car-hacking/":{"url":"m2/build-something/car-hacking/","title":"Car Hacking","keywords":"","body":"Car Hacking\n\nWhere to start?\nWhat can I do?\nWhat protocols does my car have?\n\n"},"m2/build-something/projects/":{"url":"m2/build-something/projects/","title":"Projects","keywords":"","body":"Projects\n\nDivider break down\nWhere to find more ideas?\nLink to car hacking and getting started\n\n"},"m2/build-something/projects/quick.html":{"url":"m2/build-something/projects/quick.html","title":"Quick","keywords":"","body":"Quick M2 projects\nPolling OBD2 data via CAN\nCAN logging to SD card\n"},"m2/build-something/projects/involved.html":{"url":"m2/build-something/projects/involved.html","title":"Involved","keywords":"","body":"More Involved M2 projects\nDIGI XBEE cellular LTE\nBLE with OBD2 and Blynk\nThese projects are a little more complex.\n\nDigi XBee Cellular LTE modem example\nThis tutorial will show how to connect your car to the internet using M2, a Digi XBee Cellular LTE modem and a SIM card. For more information about this modem check out this link or read the datasheet.\nSetup\nThe modem plugs directly into the 20 pin wireless socket on top of M2. Make sure that it is oriented correctly with the angled chamfers pointed toward the USB/SD side of M2. Make sure M2 is not being powered when plugging in the modem.\nBefore plugging the modem into M2, make sure to install a SIM card. This Modem uses a 4FF (Nano) size SIM card.\n\nBasic communication\nA good first step is to check that everything is working by talking to the modem with your computer through M2. For this, we program M2 with a simple sketch that will forward data between the 2 serial ports:\n\nUSBSerial = USB connection between M2 processor and your computer.\nSerial0 = Serial connection between M2 processor and XBEE socket pins\n\nThis sketch will also make the GREEN LED blink as the associate pin of the modem toggles. The pin signals and locations for the modem can be found here.\n\nconst int DIGI_Associate_PIN  = XBEE_MULT2;   // xbee pin 15\nconst int DIGI_RESET_PIN = XBEE_RST;          // xbee pin 5\nconst int GREEN_LED =  DS6;                   // the number of the LED pin\nint AssociateState = 0;                       // variable for reading the associate status\n\nvoid setup() {\n  // initialize both serial ports:\n  Serial.begin(9600);\n  SerialUSB.begin(9600);\n  pinMode(DIGI_Associate_PIN, INPUT);\n  pinMode(GREEN_LED, OUTPUT);\n  pinMode(DIGI_RESET_PIN, OUTPUT);\n  digitalWrite(DIGI_RESET_PIN, LOW);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  // read from port 1, send to port 0:\n  if (SerialUSB.available()) {\n    int inByte = SerialUSB.read();\n    Serial.write(inByte);\n  }\n\n  // read from port 0, send to port 1:\n  if (Serial.available()) {\n    int inByte = Serial.read();\n    SerialUSB.write(inByte);\n  }\n\n  AssociateState = digitalRead(DIGI_Associate_PIN);\n\n  if (AssociateState == HIGH) {\n    // turn LED on:\n    digitalWrite(GREEN_LED, HIGH);\n  } else {\n    // turn LED off:\n    digitalWrite(GREEN_LED, LOW);\n  }\n\n}\n\nThe second part to a basic communication test is the software on your computer. Digi offers a nice UI called XCTU to communicate with their products. Download the latest verison here.\nOnce downloaded and installed, launch XCTU and follow the instructions from Digi's documentation found here.\nFrom there, you can do all sorts of fun things, from sending a SMS to connecting to servers to posting data to a website. Several examples are found on Digi's documentaion page here.\nA more advanced cellular project\nThe next step is to replace the commands coming from your computer with commands directly from M2! In other words, the processor on M2 will communicate with the modem without intervention. Let's do a more advanced project!\nTo be continued...\n"},"m2/technical-references/":{"url":"m2/technical-references/","title":"Technical References","keywords":"","body":"Technical references\n\nInstallation\nProcessor\nInterfaces\nCommunication\nPower\nMemory\n12V IO\nLEDS/Buttons\nMechanical\nBYOB\n\n"},"m2/technical-references/installation.html":{"url":"m2/technical-references/installation.html","title":"Installation","keywords":"","body":"Installation\nUTD (Under the Dash)\nUTH (Under the Hood)\n\nUTD Under-the-Dash\nThe \"Under-the-Dash\" version of M2 plugs directly into the OBD2 port of the modern car.

This table is only applicable when using the M2 board as selected from the Tools -> Board menu from the Arduino IDE. See more information here.\nUse the names in the \"Mapped Pin Name\" in your Arduino Sketch.\nAn alternative method is for re-mapping pin names is the \"SamNonDuePin\" library found here.\nA \"pin mapping\" describes how the different circuits of M2 are connected to the processor. For example, the Green LED (DS6 on the schematic) is connected to pin 7 (AKA PA14) of the processor. To make things easier from a programming standpoint, we can map this to a pin name, in this case, the green LED is mapped to pin 23.\nThe following table builds on the pin mapping for the Arduino Due

Interfaces\nCAN\nSingle-wire CAN\nLIN\nK-line\nJ1850 PWM/VPW\n\nThe lower board of M2 contains both the power supply circuitry and the automotive interfaces required to communicate with your car. This includes:\n\n2x CAN bus\n1x SWCAN (single wire can)\n2x LIN/9141\nJ1805 VPW/PWM\n\n\nIn addition, every M2 has a 26 pin \"expansion\" connector that provides even more connection options. For example: UART, SPI, I2C, general purpose 12V drivers and 12V analog inputs. See the schematic for actual pinout details:\nhttps://github.com/macchina/m2-hardware\nRefer to the following diagram for pin 1 location.\n\n\nCAN\nController Area Network\nCAN bus is a vehicle bus standard used in most cars built after 2006. It is a message-based protocol that allows modules within a car to communicate with one another. While the physical layer is understood and open, the actual meaning of the messages sent over the bus are not. While some messages are legislated to be \"standard\", the majority of CAN messages in your typical car are not well documented.\nM2 has 2 CAN channels (In addition to a Single-wire CAN channel) that can interface directly to the CAN bus network of your car. M2 uses the 2 built-in CAN controllers found in the SAM3X and 2 external TJA1051 transceivers.\nHere is the link to the datasheet: http://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/TJA1051.pdf\nCAN bus connections can be found on either the 16 pin OBD2 connector on the UTD M2 or the 24 pin connector used on the UTH M2.\nArduino libraries are well developed and available here:\nhttps://github.com/collin80/due_can\n[TO DO: Discuss termination and how to terminate with solder jumpers on interface board.]\n[TO DO: Add schematic page for CAN bus transceivers]\n\nSingle-wire CAN\nHere is where we talk about all the SW can libraries.\n\nLIN\nLocal Interconnect Network\nLIN bus is an inexpensive, single wire, serial network protocol used in many modern cars. Typically, LIN would be used to control and monitor lower-priority devices such as seat positions, door locks, radio and illumination.\nM2 has 2 LIN channels that can interface directly to the LIN bus network of your car. M2 uses 2 external TJA1021 transceivers connected via UART to the processor.\nHere is the link to the datasheet: http://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/TJA1021.pdf\nNote that the TJA1021 transceiver is used for both LIN and ISO9141 (K-LINE/L-LINE) for a a total of 2 channels.\nLIN bus connections can be found on either the 16 pin OBD2 connector on the UTD M2 or the 24 pin connector used on the UTH M2.\n\nArduino libraries are available here: https://github.com/macchina/LIN\n\nK-line\nISO9141 (K-Line) interface uses the TJA1021.

Unlike most Arduino implementations of SD, we chose to employ the HSMCI (High Speed MultiMedia Card Interface) as the connection method. The result being both faster reading and writing, and freeing up the SPI interface for other fun stuff. If for some reason, SPI is needed, we did include some 0 ohm jumpers on the PCB to allow for SPI connection. These are left open by default.\n\nFor in-depth explaination of how the HSMCI works, refer to the SAM3X datasheet , starting on page 909.\nUsing the SD card slot on M2 is pretty straight-forward since all of complexities are abstracted through a library.
